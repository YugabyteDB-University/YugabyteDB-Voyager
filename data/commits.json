Right now we push  down a call to yb_hash_code if its arguments exactly match the set of hashed columns in  the primary key of an index.    For example, if we have a table created as follows.    ```  CREATE TABLE hhh (X INT PRIMARY KEY, Y INT, Z INT);  ```    In that case, the following query should push down calls to yb_hash_code to DocDB.    ```  SELECT * FROM hhh WHERE yb_hash_code(x) < 512;  ```    The following query should not push down anything however as there is not index that has x and y in  the hashed components of its primary key. YSQL will receive all tuples of hhh and apply the filter.    ```  SELECT * FROM hhh WHERE yb_hash_code(x, y) < 512;  ```    This diff also costs clauses that involve the yb_hash_code function by analyzing the proportion of the  total hash value space it requires.    This diff extends preexisting regress tests on queries that filter on a hash column by transforming these  to be filters on the hash value of that column instead. For example, any test file that included a query  such as    ```  CREATE TABLE sample_table (h int primary key, v int);  SELECT * FROM sample_table WHERE h = 5;  ```  Now also has a new query of the form  ```  SELECT * FROM sample_table WHERE yb_hash_code(h) = yb_hash_code(5);  ```    Test Plan:  ./yb_build.sh --java-test 'org.yb.pgsql.TestPgRegressProc'  && ./yb_build.sh --java-test 'org.yb.pgsql.TestPgRegressIndex'  && ./yb_build.sh --java-test 'org.yb.pgsql.TestPgRegressTrigger'  && ./yb_build.sh --java-test 'org.yb.pgsql.TestPgRegressMisc'  && ./yb_build.sh --java-test 'org.yb.pgsql.TestPgRegressPlanner'    Reviewers: neil, mihnea    Reviewed By: mihnea    Subscribers: mihnea, jason    Differential Revision: https://phabricator.dev.yugabyte.com/D12013","tree":{"sha":"971d8b49e6831a95a16206afde9ebb6c408981f9","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jharveysmith/yugabyte-db/git/trees/971d8b49e6831a95a16206afde9ebb6c408981f9"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jharveysmith/yugabyte-db/git/commits/7d3f6895c8f8d0deb094e9a102d56a09d9fe0af1","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jharveysmith/yugabyte-db/commits/7d3f6895c8f8d0deb094e9a102d56a09d9fe0af1","html_url":"https://github.com/jharveysmith/yugabyte-db/commit/7d3f6895c8f8d0deb094e9a102d56a09d9fe0af1","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jharveysmith/yugabyte-db/commits/7d3f6895c8f8d0deb094e9a102d56a09d9fe0af1/comments","author":{"login":"tanujnay112","id":3924842,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MjQ4NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3924842?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanujnay112","html_url":"https://github.com/tanujnay112","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanujnay112/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanujnay112/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanujnay112/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanujnay112/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanujnay112/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanujnay112/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanujnay112/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanujnay112/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanujnay112/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"tanujnay112","id":3924842,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MjQ4NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3924842?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanujnay112","html_url":"https://github.com/tanujnay112","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanujnay112/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanujnay112/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanujnay112/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanujnay112/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanujnay112/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanujnay112/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanujnay112/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanujnay112/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanujnay112/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"fc574da66c74de3f339f88da134dcc4b2a6f3b5c","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jharveysmith/yugabyte-db/commits/fc574da66c74de3f339f88da134dcc4b2a6f3b5c","html_url":"https://github.com/jharveysmith/yugabyte-db/commit/fc574da66c74de3f339f88da134dcc4b2a6f3b5c"}]},{"sha":"fc574da66c74de3f339f88da134dcc4b2a6f3b5c","node_id":"C_kwDOETM58doAKGZjNTc0ZGE2NmM3NGRlM2YzMzlmODhkYTEzNGRjYzRiMmE2ZjNiNWM","commit":{"author":{"name":"Muthu Chidambaram","email":"mchidambaram@yugabyte.com","date":"2021-11-02T08:07:11Z"},"committer":{"name":"Muthu Chidambaram","email":"mchidambaram@yugabyte.com","date":"2021-11-02T17:53:37Z"},"message":"[PLAT-2111] Systemd Upgrade failing with read replica    Summary:  Upgrading universe to systemd fails if universe has a read replica.

Currently, the following definition is applicable for inactive tablets:  1) Not yet deleted split parent tablets for which we've already registered child split tablets.  2) Tablets that are marked as HIDDEN for PITR.    The `DeleteTable` path is inconsistent with the above definition(s). In particular, we should ensure the following during delete:  1. If the tablet is hidden or being deleted, it should be present only in `tablets_`  2. If the tablet is completely deleted (i.e. from all tservers), it should not be present in `tablets_` or `partitions_`  3. `partitions_` should always be a subset of `tablets_`    Test Plan: Jenkins    Reviewers: timur, bogdan, sergei    Reviewed By: sergei    Subscribers: ybase    Differential Revision: https://phabricator.dev.yugabyte.com/D13348","tree":{"sha":"c939cdc23c2fc2582f7e1f235e4113cb1633452f","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jharveysmith/yugabyte-db/git/trees/c939cdc23c2fc2582f7e1f235e4113cb1633452f"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jharveysmith/yugabyte-db/git/commits/267f024cee49f6a6d36b64626772660b18d4da00","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jharveysmith/yugabyte-db/commits/267f024cee49f6a6d36b64626772660b18d4da00","html_url":"https://github.com/jharveysmith/yugabyte-db/commit/267f024cee49f6a6d36b64626772660b18d4da00","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jharveysmith/yugabyte-db/commits/267f024cee49f6a6d36b64626772660b18d4da00/comments","author":{"login":"sanketkedia","id":14816236,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODE2MjM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14816236?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanketkedia","html_url":"https://github.com/sanketkedia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanketkedia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanketkedia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanketkedia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanketkedia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanketkedia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanketkedia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanketkedia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanketkedia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanketkedia/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"sanketkedia","id":14816236,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODE2MjM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14816236?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanketkedia","html_url":"https://github.com/sanketkedia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanketkedia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanketkedia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanketkedia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanketkedia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanketkedia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanketkedia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanketkedia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanketkedia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanketkedia/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"2d6026bc89aa891cd165e2180c8a2a55553be686","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jharveysmith/yugabyte-db/commits/2d6026bc89aa891cd165e2180c8a2a55553be686","html_url":"https://github.com/jharveysmith/yugabyte-db/commit/2d6026bc89aa891cd165e2180c8a2a55553be686"}]},{"sha":"2d6026bc89aa891cd165e2180c8a2a55553be686","node_id":"C_kwDOETM58doAKDJkNjAyNmJjODlhYTg5MWNkMTY1ZTIxODBjOGEyYTU1NTUzYmU2ODY","commit":{"author":{"name":"Yury Shchetinin","email":"yshchetinin@yugabyte.com","date":"2021-10-25T15:02:43Z"},"committer":{"name":"Yury Shchetinin","email":"yshchetinin@yugabyte.com","date":"2021-11-02T11:12:36Z"},"message":"[Platform][PLAT-1956] Expose preflight check as a standalone action    Summary:  Added ability to perform preflight check for on-prem nodes.

ignoreMissingMigration and default java package issue    Summary:  Also `ensureJavaFriendlyLocation` to workaround default being reserved keyword in java     We will allow for adding java classes to db/migration/default_/common (Note the underscore) when dbName is default  For `ignoreMissingMigrations` issue See [[ https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U_jEvOfTS3ofD-3NDL21soQxYxTu0pmdd-DEKZu_ynA/edit# | DB Migration Versioning Background ]]  Our design options are limited to just Option#2 Use repeatable migrations for backport.    This is very limiting and something we would like to get out of.  We are specifically blocked by  https://github.com/flyway/flyway-play/issues/96 which has not seen any traction.    At the same time we do not want to hand-roll our own flyway-play plugin and config mechanism  mainly due to additional testing overhead.  Also one day we will migrate to play 2.8.X and then we can upgrade to latest plugin with  all the fixes we want.    The code is identical to:    org.flywaydb.play.PlayInitializer  Only addition of    ybPatchAdditionalConfigurations and ensureJavaFriendlyLocation methods that get called during configuring flyway.  Rest of the classes are being used from plugin as-is  Ideally could have used inheritance and not repeated even this class's code. Unfortunately all the interesting methods and properties needed  to do what we want; were private.    Test Plan:  Unfortunatly resources in test path are not picked up by fakedbapp. So had to resort to manual testing.    - Deleted  V98 migration.  - Got error  - Disable flyway plugin and set `ignoreMissingMigrations=true` in `application.conf`  - No error during startup.

of a parallel worker when reporting a long error message.    Summary:  Commit was 526df0a236df7d6d12ea91e9538af7efc5896d25    Commit message was:      Because sigsetjmp() will restore the initial state with signals blocked,      the code path in bgworker.c for reporting an error and exiting would      execute that way.  Usually this is fairly harmless; but if a parallel      worker had an error message exceeding the shared-memory communication      buffer size (16K) it would lock up, because it would wait for a      resume-sending signal from its parallel leader which it would never      detect.        To fix, just unblock signals at the appropriate point.        This can be shown to fail back to 9.6.  The lack of parallel query      infrastructure makes it difficult to provide a simple test case for      9.5; but I'm pretty sure the issue exists in some form there as well,      so apply the code change there too.

On macOS, we still use fork+exec because posix_spawnp throws errors related to closing file descriptors. Making sure all files in our code are opened with FD_CLOEXEC is out of scope of this revision, and will be addressed by #10321.  - #10295 - fix undefined behavior (adding to a null pointer) in a Postgres sorting function.  - Fix HostPort& field type in ysql_upgrade.h (make it HostPort). Otherwise there is an ASAN issue accessing a deallocated stack value. (No separate GitHub issue for this bug.)    Also consolidating Status generation from a C standard library error number in errno.h and errno.c, and adding a few utility macros for convenient invocation of C functions that either return an errno as the return value, or return zero vs. non zero depending on whether there is an error, and set errno as a side effect.    As part of this diff, we are removing Clang 7 ASAN build on CentOS 7 from Jenkins (we don't need two different ASAN builds).

To fix that ad ensure same OIDs are used across different databases,, `ysql_upgrade_max_oid` has been moved out of shared memory to be a private global variable.    Note that the mismatch can currently also happen is an insert into a shared relation without a predefined OID, but such migration does't exist yet, nor do we anticipate them to appear.
