    "# Demystifying table sharding, tablets, and data distribution\n",
    "As a distributed SQL database, YugabyteDB stores data differently than a stand-alone, monolithic  database. Because data is stored differently, YugabyteDB reads and writes data differently as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like a monolithic relational databases, YugabyteDB stores data in tables. However, in YugabyteDB, a distributed database, a table consists of tablets. \n",
    "\n",
    "A tablet represents a table shard which contains a set of rows for the logical table. Tablets for a table often exists in a peer group of leader and followers. This group of tablet peers exists as a Raft consensus group. Each tablet is a customized RocksDB instance. RocksDB is a persistent key-value database. This architecture of a table existing as tablet peers in a Raft consensus group where each tablet is a customized RocksDB key-value database is called DocDB, Yugabyte's distributed document store.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, using Explain Plans, built-in functions, and custom utilities for YB-TServer metrics, you will learn:\n",
    "- how YugabyteDB stores data for a table in one or more tablets using either hash consistent sharding or range sharding\n",
    "- how YugabyteDB reads tablet data during query execution\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "In this notebook, you learned about how YugabyteDB uses two distinct sharding strategies for storing data in a distributed manner for tables in tablets:\n",
    "- consistent hash sharding\n",
    "- range sharding\n",
    "\n",
    "You specify the sharding strategy in the Primary Key definition of a table: `hash` for hash sharding, and either `asc` or `desc` for range sharding.\n",
    "By default, YSQL for YugabyteDB employs consistent hash sharding, even if a primary key is not defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Consistent hash sharding\n",
    "With consistent hash sharding, YugabyteDB evenly and randomly distributes data across tablets using a partitioning algorithm. By computing a consistent hash on the partition column values of that row, YugabyteDB places each row of the table into a tablet. By using the `yb_hash_code()` built-in function, you can view the integer form of a hash coded value.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Benefits of hash sharding\n",
    "Because consistent hash sharding distributes data evenly across all the nodes in the cluster while also retaining the ability to horizontally scale (add or remove nodes) in a YugabyteDB cluster, the strategy is ideal for massively scalable workloads that require shard key predicate queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Concerns with hash sharding\n",
    "However, performing range queries could be inefficient. Examples of range queries are finding rows greater than a lower bound or less than an upper bound (as opposed to point lookups).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Range sharding\n",
    "Range sharding involves splitting the rows of a table into contiguous ranges that respect the sort order of the table based on the primary key column values. YugabyteDB initially creates a single tablet leader for a table. with range sharding. As the data volume increases for the table, YugabyteDB dynamically splits the initial tablet into two or moore tablets. \n",

    "#### Benefits of range sharding\n",
    "Range harding allows efficiently querying a range of rows by the primary key values. Examples of such a query is to look up all keys that lie between a lower bound and an upper bound.\n",

    "#### Concerns with range sharding\n",
    "Range sharding can introduce a number of issues in practice and at scale. Starting out with a single tablet leader implies only a single node is handling all the user queries, making this node in the cluster \"hot\" in terms of CPU, Memory,  Network, and Disk utilization. To alleviate this side effect, the data volume must grow significantly in order for the tablet to split. Another concern is that the global ordering of keys across all the tablets itself generates hot spots. As a result, certain tablet will naturally have more activity than others, resulting in an node with increased utilization of CPU, Memory, Network, and Disk."
